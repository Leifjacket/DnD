How to use the Mass Roll Simulator
1. In Folder Executables/Zips download the Exact or Approximate Zip
  Exact: The version that just rolls the D20s and tells you the outcome (seen in above example)
  Approximate: The version where it tells you the expected outcome and you can roll approximate it with 2D4s yourself
2. Unzip and start the executable: MaRoSi.exe is the Approximate version and MaRoSiEx.exe the Exact version 
3. Optional: send the shortcut to the executable to your desktop/dnd folder so you don't have to go into the installation folder everytime
4. enjoy :)
